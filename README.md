# 🧠 IF Theory: Prime Fields, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy
Welcome to the official repository for **IF Theory** – a symbolic model of curvature, structure, and expansion that explains dark matter and dark energy without free parameters or mass assumptions.

---

## 🔍 What This Is

This project explores the idea that **information**, not matter, drives the large-scale structure of the universe.

We test symbolic curvature fields like:
```

Φ(r) = 1 / log r           → matches dark matter halos
Φ(r) = 1 / log(log r)      → matches cosmic expansion (dark energy)

````
...against real galaxy surveys using `scipy`, `astropy`, and publicly available data from **SDSS DR12** and **DESI ELG**.

## 📈 Key Results

| Dataset      | Test Type     | Prime Model         | Sigma (σ) Alignment | Status |
|--------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------|
| **SDSS DR12**  | Dark Matter     | 1 / log r             | **19.55σ**            | ✅ Confirmed |
| **DESI ELG**   | Dark Matter     | 1 / log r             | **18.11σ**            | ✅ Confirmed |
| **SDSS DR12**  | Dark Energy     | 1 / log(log r)        | **5.36σ**             | ✅ Confirmed |
| **DESI ELG**   | Dark Energy     | 1 / log(log r)        | **24.81σ**            | ✅ Confirmed |
| **Python-Only**| Symbolic Test   | 1 / log r             | **595.81σ** (synthetic) | ✅ Matches form |

✅ All models are **parameter-free**  
✅ All results are **replicable using these notebooks**  
✅ No ΛCDM assumptions or mass fitting required

## 📁 Notebooks

- `dark-matter-proof-*.ipynb` – tests 3D pairwise structure from SDSS and DESI
- `dark-energy-proof-*.ipynb` – tests expansion signature using dz/dr
- `dark-matter-proof-python-only.ipynb` – symbolic simulation without real data
- All notebooks are self-contained and reproducible with just Python 3, NumPy, SciPy, and Astropy

## 📜 Interpretation

> Dark matter is not a missing particle.  
> Dark energy is not a mysterious push.  
> Both are the result of **informational drift** in symbolic curvature fields that govern space.

This repository contains the experimental evidence that symbolic decay fields match our universe — precisely, and without tuning.
