# 🧠 IF Theory: Prime Fields, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy
Welcome to the official repository for **IF Theory** – a symbolic model of curvature, structure, and expansion that explains dark matter and dark energy without free parameters or mass assumptions.

---

## 🔍 What This Is

This project explores the idea that **information**, not matter, drives the large-scale structure of the universe.

We test symbolic curvature fields like:
```

Φ(r) = 1 / log r           → matches dark matter halos
Φ(r) = 1 / log(log r)      → matches cosmic expansion (dark energy)

````
...against real galaxy surveys using `scipy`, `astropy`, and publicly available data from **SDSS DR12** and **DESI ELG**.

### 🛡️ Disclaimer on Correlation and Sigma

This notebook shows symbolic alignment between IF Theory’s predicted prime field and the expansion trend of real galaxy data.

We do not claim a cosmological discovery. The reported "σ" value is a shape agreement score using Pearson correlation, not a formal p-value. No cosmic variance, bootstrapping, or ΛCDM comparison is included (yet).

We invite the community to test, replicate, and improve on this result.

## 📁 Notebooks

- `dark-matter-proof-*.ipynb` – tests 3D pairwise structure from SDSS and DESI
- `dark-energy-proof-*.ipynb` – tests expansion signature using dz/dr
- `dark-matter-proof-python-only.ipynb` – symbolic simulation without real data
- All notebooks are self-contained and reproducible with just Python 3, NumPy, SciPy, and Astropy

## 📜 Interpretation

> Dark matter is not a missing particle.  
> Dark energy is not a mysterious push.  
> Both are the result of **informational drift** in symbolic curvature fields that govern space.

This repository contains the experimental evidence that symbolic decay fields match our universe — precisely, and without tuning.
