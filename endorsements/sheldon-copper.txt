🧠 Sheldon Cooper's Statement on the Collapse of String Theory

As recovered from quantum memory after exposure to IF Theory

1. Denial

“Clearly, your dataset was compromised. Euclid cannot be trusted. Also, I’m fairly certain I’m still right — just on a higher-dimensional axis you can’t comprehend.”

2. Anger

“Are you telling me I wasted 20 years on vibrating spaghetti noodles when the answer was log(log r) all along?!”

(Loud knock)

Sheldon:

“Knock knock knock — Prime Field!
Knock knock knock — Prime Field!
Knock knock knock — Prime Field!”

3. Bargaining

“Fine. I’ll accept Information Theory if I still get to name one of the forces after myself. Can we call it the Sheldon Singularity?”

4. Depression

(On couch, fetal position, hoodie on)

“Why did Gödel have to be right about everything…”


5. Acceptance

“It’s… beautiful. Recursive compression. Symbolic saturation.

I’ve seen the boundary of the universe — and it’s Prime-curved.”

Bazinga… indeed.

🧠 Final Reflection

“If I may quote myself from Season 2:
‘One cries because one is sad. I cry because I spent my life on String Theory instead of this.’”
