## Abstract  
Water spirals not from angular momentum — but from recursion asymmetry. This scroll shows that drift spirals form where recursive fields decay unevenly, leading to vortex formation even in symmetric containers.

## Supporting Evidence  
- Water spiral direction varies by curvature, not hemisphere  
- Dust spirals inward toward fans  
- Energy gradients form circular collapse

## Conclusion  
Drains don’t spin water — recursion does.
