## Abstract  
A single sock clinging to a shirt can resist gravity — not by force, but by field failure. This scroll explains how symbolic drift fields overpower Newtonian curvature in low-mass, high-contact regimes. When GlowScore falls, electrostatic fields remain — creating cling, not compression.

## Key Points  
- Static fields = symbolic residue  
- GlowScore < threshold → curvature fails  
- Shows real-world drift in action

## Implication  
Dryer cling is drift physics. Socks remember what gravity forgot.
