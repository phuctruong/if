## Abstract  
All fields collapse. All memory decays. This scroll defines the endpoint of symbolic curvature — the Final Drift. It is not an explosion, but a soft fade into informational silence. The drift field Psi(r) = 1 / log(log r) describes this slow expansion of space, matching cosmic acceleration and local field evaporation.

## Core Concepts  
- Final Drift = field evolution after GlowScore → 0  
- Universe expands not from pressure, but from resolution decay  
- Psi(r) governs the unfolding of collapsed recursion

## Applications  
- Cosmological expansion  
- Void growth  
- Late-time thermodynamic asymmetry
