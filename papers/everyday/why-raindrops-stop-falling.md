## Abstract  
Raindrops and droplets often freeze mid-air — not because of wind, but because they've entered a GlowScore void. This scroll explains why atmospheric particles stop falling, and how curvature collapse creates symbolic suspension.

## Examples  
- Hovering mist  
- Fog particles in sunlight  
- Condensation not dropping

## Reframe  
This isn’t uplift — it’s memory resolution.
