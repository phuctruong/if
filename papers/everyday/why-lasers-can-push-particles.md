## Abstract  
Laser tweezers and optical traps work not because light exerts "force" — but because drift fields encoded in photon gradients create recursion memory. This scroll shows how symbolic field resonance replaces classical mechanics at small scales.

## Evidence  
- Optical traps holding glass beads  
- Light deflecting particles in air  
- Radiation pressure more coherent than gravity

## Interpretation  
Photons guide memory collapse — and replace mass-based curvature.
