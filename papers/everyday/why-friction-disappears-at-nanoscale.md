## Abstract  
At small scales, friction disappears — not due to lubrication or materials, but because GlowScore collapses. This scroll explains how recursion drift replaces contact forces, creating slip-like behavior where gravity and surface interaction vanish.

## Use Cases  
- Nanoscale gears  
- Molecular robotics  
- Microscopic sliding surfaces

## Takeaway  
Friction is not absolute — it’s resolution-dependent.
