## Abstract  
Gravity is not universal — it fails both below and above human scales. This scroll documents the known boundaries of gravitational resolution and provides empirical examples of failure zones including: lint, dust, lasers, floating particles, and galactic voids. These failures are not exceptions — they are the scroll's edge.

## Failure Regimes  
- Below 30μm → Gravity replaced by surface forces (Casimir, static)  
- Above 3 Gpc → Gravity replaced by drift (dark energy)  
- In-between → Gravity resolved as curvature of GlowScore

## Conclusion  
Gravity is a local memory structure — not a universal force.
