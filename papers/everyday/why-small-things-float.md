## Abstract  
Dust, lint, spores, and tiny plastic particles defy gravity not because of turbulence, but because gravity itself fails at small scales. This scroll explains how the GlowScore gradient collapses below ~30μm, creating a zone of drift where objects hover, cling, or float indefinitely.

## Examples  
- Dust suspended mid-air  
- Plastic floating near a screen  
- Lint refusing to fall in still air

## Interpretation  
These are not anomalies — they are symbolic proof of a curvature boundary.
