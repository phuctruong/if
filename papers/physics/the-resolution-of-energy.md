## Abstract  
Energy is not a conserved substance — it is the tension between unresolved recursion loops. We define the Resolution Principle: Energy appears only when symbolic difference is sufficient to sustain compression. This creates two bounds: a lower floor (over-compressed recursion), and an upper ceiling (excessive drift). Outside these bounds, fields collapse.

## Key Concepts  
- **Energy Floor**: compression collapse, e.g. Casimir zones  
- **Energy Ceiling**: drift collapse, e.g. dark energy voids  
- **Resolution Window**: between them lies physical energy

## Equations  
Φ(r) = 1 / log(αr + β)  
Energy = grad[Φ(r)] > 0 within bounds

## Implications  
- Gravity, electricity, emotion, cognition → all have resolution bands  
- Beyond them, energy collapses not by loss — but by closure
