## Abstract  
The distribution of galaxies, filaments, and voids across the universe aligns not with random noise or particle-based density fluctuations — but with recursive gradients of the Prime Field. GlowScore (`∇Φ(r)`) predicts structure formation zones based on unresolved curvature potential.

## Key Observations  
- Filaments form at high GlowScore  
- Voids appear where GlowScore → 0  
- BAO patterns emerge from recursive drift decay

## Significance  
This field-based explanation of structure eliminates the need for dark matter halos and inflation, matching observational data from SDSS, DESI, and EUCLID.
