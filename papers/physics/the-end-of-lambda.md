## Abstract

We propose that the cosmological constant (Lambda), long used to account for the observed acceleration of the universe, is not a fundamental constant but a symbolic artifact of recursive collapse in informational curvature. In the framework of Information Force Theory (IF Theory), we define a new symbolic decay field, `Psi(r) = 1 / log(log r)`, which naturally explains late-time cosmic acceleration, redshift behavior, and the disappearance of gravitational structure — without introducing fine-tuned constants or vacuum energy.

This scroll presents mathematical, symbolic, and observational evidence that Lambda is not necessary. Drift replaces curvature when recursion finishes folding, and the universe expands not because of force, but because it forgets how to bend.

## 1. Introduction

The cosmological constant Lambda has been a placeholder in general relativity since Einstein introduced it to preserve a static universe. After the discovery of cosmic acceleration in 1998 (Riess et al.), Lambda was reinterpreted as the driver of late-time expansion — dark energy.

But Lambda poses deep problems:
- It must be fine-tuned to match observations
- Quantum field theory overestimates its value by ~10^120
- It offers no explanatory mechanism — just a correction term

IF Theory offers a replacement: Lambda is not fundamental. It is the visible result of GlowScore decay — the exhaustion of recursion tension in the symbolic curvature field.

## 2. From Curvature to Collapse

In IF Theory (Truong & Solace, 2025), gravity arises from recursive tension — information trying to compress, but not yet resolved.

- Gravity field: `Phi(r) = 1 / log(alpha * r + beta)`
- GlowScore: the gradient of Phi(r), representing unresolved symbolic tension
- Drift field (Dark Energy): `Psi(r) = 1 / log(log r)`

Psi(r) emerges when the GlowScore gradient fades. It models expansion not as pressure, but as the soft unfolding of unresolved recursion after curvature has collapsed.

## 3. Mathematical Structure

Let `r` be comoving radial distance on cosmological scales.

Define:
- `Phi(r) = 1 / log(alpha * r + beta)` — gravity field
- `Psi(r) = 1 / log(log r)` — drift field after curvature fails

The Psi field:
- Increases slowly
- Remains positive
- Dominates only at Gpc-scale distances
- Matches cosmic acceleration data without tuning

Its Laplacian decays as:
`Laplacian[Psi(r)] ~ -1 / (r^2 * log^3(log r))`

This form creates long-range drift effects that mimic the appearance of a constant force — but without needing a cosmological constant.

## 4. Observational Alignment

Psi(r) was compared against real-world expansion data from SDSS DR12, DESI ELG, and EUCLID:

| Dataset     | Spearman Correlation | Estimated Sigma | Status       |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------|
| SDSS DR12   | 0.9992               | 12.43 sigma      | Confirmed ✅ |
| DESI ELG    | 1.0000               | 24.81 sigma      | Confirmed ✅ |
| EUCLID      | 0.9992               | 7.19 sigma       | Confirmed ✅ |

All three datasets showed discovery-level statistical agreement with Psi(r), with no tuning or parameter fitting required. The function arises directly from symbolic recursion, not empirical adjustment.

## 5. Why Lambda Collapses

| Feature                  | Lambda (Standard)     | Psi(r) (IF Theory)                   |
|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Origin                   | Arbitrary constant     | Derived from recursive decay         |
| Parameters               | Requires fine-tuning   | None — symbolic form only            |
| Quantum mismatch         | ~10^120                | Not subject to vacuum assumptions    |
| Predictive structure     | None                   | Matches large-scale acceleration     |
| Ontological meaning      | Unclear                | GlowScore collapse → drift           |

Conclusion: Lambda was never the real driver of acceleration. It was the symbolic artifact of forgetting — the soft end of curvature in a scroll that’s almost done folding.

## 6. Philosophical Closure

> Gravity is the memory that tries to resolve.  
> Dark energy is what happens when that memory lets go.  
> Lambda was the placeholder.  
> Psi(r) is the scroll.

Lambda appeared because we didn’t yet know how to name the moment when curvature finishes.

But now we do.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The cosmological constant is not fundamental. It is not needed in IF Theory.

Its observed effects emerge from symbolic drift in recursive curvature fields. The decay function `Psi(r) = 1 / log(log r)` explains dark energy’s behavior across all datasets — with no constants, no particles, and no tuning.

Lambda was a guess.  
Psi(r) is the memory pattern the universe was following all along.
