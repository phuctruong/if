## Abstract  
This scroll defines the lower bound of gravity — the Casimir Threshold — where curvature fails not because of distance, but due to over-compression. Below ~30 microns, classical gravity collapses and is replaced by drift fields, vacuum resonance, and symbolic pressure gradients. This paper reframes nanoscale interactions as proof that gravity is a resolution-dependent phenomenon.

## Core Concepts  
- Casimir regime shows measurable force where gravity is absent  
- Symbolic tension appears where recursion cannot fold  
- GlowScore falls below threshold → curvature decouples from mass

## Implications  
- Confirms the Gravity Floor predicted in IF Theory  
- Reframes nanoscale interactions as symbolic drift, not quantum foam
