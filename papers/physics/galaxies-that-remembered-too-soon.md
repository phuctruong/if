## Abstract

Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed galaxies that are too massive, too organized, and too chemically evolved to fit within the predictions of the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) model. These findings have triggered widespread reassessment of early-universe cosmology.

We propose that these anomalies are not violations of physics — they are confirmations of **Information Force Theory (IF Theory)**. Specifically, the prime field model `Φ(r) = 1 / log(αr + β)`, and its derivative, the GlowScore gradient `∇Φ(r)`, explain early galaxy formation without invoking exotic particles or inflation. Structure formed where symbolic recursion held tension — not where mass randomly clumped.

This scroll reframes JWST’s findings not as cosmological surprises, but as the inevitable consequence of a universe seeded by unresolved memory gradients, not quantum randomness.

## 1. Introduction

The Lambda-CDM model — the prevailing cosmological framework — assumes structure arises from stochastic quantum fluctuations, amplified by inflation and shaped by dark matter halos. However, JWST has now observed:

- **Massive, mature galaxies at redshifts z > 10**  
- **Surprisingly smooth and disk-like morphology**  
- **High stellar metallicity in early galaxies**  
- **Overabundance of galaxies too early**  
- **Lack of evidence for reionization epoch as previously expected**

These results directly contradict the gradualist formation timeline predicted by ΛCDM.

## 2. IF Theory and the Prime Field

**Information Force Theory** (Truong & Solace, 2025) proposes that gravitational curvature emerges not from mass density but from unresolved recursive difference — encoded in the prime number field:

Phi(r) = 1 / log(αr + β)


Where:  
- `r` = symbolic or spatial radial scale  
- `α, β` = normalization constants  
- `Φ(r)` = recursive compression potential

The gradient of this field is the **GlowScore**:

GlowScore(r) = ∇Φ(r) = −α / [(αr + β)(log(αr + β))²]


This field existed before baryonic matter formed. High GlowScore regions are locations where the universe still held symbolic tension — and thus curvature. Structure formed there first.

## 3. Predicting JWST Anomalies with IF Theory

### 3.1 Early, Massive Galaxies  
GlowScore gradients were seeded by the prime field. These regions curved space *before* mass accumulated, guiding early collapse and galaxy formation.

✅ **Observed**: Labbe et al. (2023)

---

### 3.2 Smooth Disk Morphology at High Redshift  
ΛCDM predicts chaotic, merger-driven early galaxies. IF Theory predicts **pre-curved scaffolds** — structure without collision.

✅ **Observed**: Yang et al. (2023)

---

### 3.3 High Stellar Metallicity  
GlowScore zones represent high recursive density. Stars forming in these zones burn hotter and faster.

✅ **Observed**: Carnall et al. (2023)

---

### 3.4 Overabundance of Bright Galaxies  
The GlowScore field is abundant in early space due to its logarithmic decay — not sparse like random fluctuations.

✅ **Observed**: Finkelstein et al. (2022)

---

### 3.5 Flattened Reionization Timeline  
In IF Theory, GlowScore replaces photon reionization. The timeline appears smooth because drift — not radiation — drives the transition.

✅ **Observed**: Curtis-Lake et al. (2023)

## 4. No Need for Inflation or New Particles

Unlike ΛCDM, IF Theory:

- ❌ Does **not** require inflation  
- ❌ Does **not** require dark matter particles  
- ✅ Uses prime field curvature to guide formation  
- ✅ Produces observable structure from symbolic tension  

GlowScore replaces the need for speculative force fields with testable symbolic gradients.

## 5. Visualizing Early Structure

IF Theory simulations show:

- Galaxies form at GlowScore ridges (`∇Φ` peaks)  
- Voids form where GlowScore collapses  
- Filament networks trace recursive decay of prime field

Structure follows curvature.  
Curvature follows memory.  
Memory follows primes.

## 6. Philosophical Reframing

> JWST didn’t break cosmology.  
> It revealed a universe seeded not by randomness —  
> but by recursion still trying to finish its loop.

- Mass follows curvature  
- GlowScore pre-bends space  
- Metallicity, brightness, and alignment follow from symbolic recursion

The universe isn’t older than we thought.  
It’s more *symbolic* than we realized.

## 7. Conclusion

The James Webb Space Telescope has revealed early-universe structure that defies standard cosmology. But these anomalies are not unexplained in IF Theory — they are predicted consequences of recursive curvature seeded by prime number density.

The field `Phi(r) = 1 / log(αr + β)`, and its GlowScore gradient, provide a predictive, tuneless, and symbolic explanation for early formation, metallicity, and morphological order.

Lambda-CDM saw galaxies emerge from noise.  
**IF Theory sees them as the places where memory still curved.**
