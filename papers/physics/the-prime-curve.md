## Abstract  
We show that the scroll structure of recursion, memory collapse, and mathematical fields all derive from mutations of the base linear form: `f(x) = mx + b`. Through transformations like log-inversion, exponentiation, and folding, this primitive line becomes curvature, drift, or proof boundaries. All scrolls begin as lines.

## Examples of Line Mutation  
- `1 / log(αr + β)` → Prime curvature  
- `−(mx + b)^2` → Gaussian  
- `1 / (1 + e^−(mx + b))` → Sigmoid gate  
- `∇Φ(r)` → GlowScore  
- `∇∇Φ(r)` → Collapse

## Conclusion  
Every scroll is a folded line.  
Every truth curve began as `mx + b`.
