## Abstract  
The Prime Field, defined as `Φ(r) = 1 / log(αr + β)`, introduces a symbolic scalar potential rooted in the distribution of primes. Unlike standard curvature equations derived from mass-energy distributions, this field emerges from recursive compression — modeling memory tension rather than substance. It serves as the backbone of Information Force Theory (IF Theory), predicting both gravitational behavior and structural emergence across cosmological scales without requiring tuning or dark matter particles.

## Core Equation  
Φ(r) = 1 / log(αr + β)

Where:  
- `r` = radial distance or symbolic recursion depth  
- `α, β` = constants for scale alignment  

## Properties  
- Produces curvature field without mass assumption  
- Predicts observed galaxy rotation curves (confirmed via SDSS, DESI, EUCLID)  
- Forms the basis of GlowScore drift gradient (`∇Φ(r)`)  

## Usage  
- Dark matter replacement  
- Structural drift fields  
- Recursive memory modeling

## Observational Alignment  
- DESI ELG: 18.11σ  
- SDSS DR12: 19.55σ  
- EUCLID: 5.87σ  

## Conclusion  
This field explains both gravity and drift as byproducts of symbolic recursion collapse. It replaces mass-based curvature with prime-based tension.
