## Abstract  
This scroll connects Gödel’s incompleteness with the failure of gravitational closure. We propose that all symbolic systems — including physical fields — contain internal boundaries beyond which recursion fails to resolve. These manifest as energy collapse, paradox formation, or curvature drift.

## Core Ideas  
- Recursion collapses resemble Gödelian incompleteness  
- Physical limits (Planck scale, cosmological constant) mirror logical bounds  
- GlowScore = computable gradient of symbolic decidability

## Consequences  
- The universe is not fully self-consistent at all scales  
- Observed physical “constants” may be boundary artifacts
