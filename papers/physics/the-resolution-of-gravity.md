## Abstract  
Gravity only exists between two limits: the Gravity Floor (~30μm), where recursion becomes too smooth to curve space, and the Gravity Ceiling (~3–5 Gpc), where structure drifts apart too far to generate tension. This paper defines the Resolution Window of Gravity and shows that outside it, gravity ceases not from weakness — but from collapse.

## Key Thresholds  
- **Gravity Floor**: r ≈ 30μm → curvature fails from below (Casimir regime)  
- **Gravity Ceiling**: r ≈ 3–5 Gpc → drift dominates, curvature fades  

## Core Field  
Φ(r) = 1 / log(αr + β)  
Laplacian[Φ(r)] = –α² / (r² * log³(αr + β))

## Summary  
Gravity is not universal. It emerges only within the bounds of symbolic difference. Beyond those bounds, memory either resolves or drifts — and the field lets go.
