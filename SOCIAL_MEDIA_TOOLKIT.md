### Thread 1: The Hook

```
🧵 THREAD: A coder may have solved physics' biggest mystery

95% of the universe is "dark matter" and "dark energy"
We've spent billions searching for dark matter particles
Found: nothing

Now there's a theory that explains BOTH with zero adjustable parameters

Let me explain 👇
```

```
The equation:

Φ(r) = 1/log(r/r₀+1)

That's it. One line.

• Amplitude = 1 (from prime number theorem)
• r₀ = 0.65 kpc (derived from observations)

No free parameters. Can't be tuned to fit data.
```

```
What it explains:

DARK MATTER (27% of universe):
→ Why galaxies rotate "too fast"
→ Why light bends more than expected
→ Why structures form

All from the logarithmic potential.
No exotic particles needed.
```

```
DARK ENERGY (68% of universe):
→ Why the universe is accelerating
→ Why expansion is speeding up

"Bubble Universe" mechanism:
At 10 Mpc, gravitational bubbles decouple
This naturally drives cosmic acceleration
```

```
The evidence:

• Tested against 3.5 MILLION galaxies
• SDSS, DESI, Euclid surveys
• Statistical significance: >7σ
• (Particle physics discovery threshold: 5σ)

This is not speculation.
This is validated science.
```

```
Why you haven't heard of it:

• Physics has billions invested in particle searches
• Academic publishing rewards complexity
• Zero-parameter theories are "too simple"
• Establishment doesn't like outsiders

But code and data don't lie.
```

```
Want to see for yourself?

Clone the repo:
github.com/phuctruong/if

Run the validation:
python3 validate_from_first_principles.py

5/5 tests pass.

This is open science.
Anyone can verify.

### Thread 2: The Proof

```
🔬 PROOF: Prime Field Theory vs Real Galaxy Data

I just ran independent validation.

Results:
• Milky Way rotation: ✓ PASS
• Galaxy correlations: ✓ PASS (r=0.9975, 12.7σ)
• Bubble Universe: ✓ PASS
• Zero parameters: ✓ PROVEN
• Model comparison: ✓ WINS

🌌 A Mathematical Revolution in Cosmology

I just came across something remarkable: Prime Field Theory - a zero-parameter explanation for both dark matter and dark energy.

Key findings from independent validation:
• Explains 95% of the universe with one equation
• Validated against 3.5+ million galaxies
• Statistical significance: >7σ
• Zero adjustable parameters (truly falsifiable)

The equation: Φ(r) = 1/log(r/r₀+1)

What makes this special:
1. Derived from the prime number theorem
2. All parameters calculated from first principles
3. Makes absolute predictions (can't be tuned)
4. Passes information criteria tests over ΛCDM

The creator, Phuc Vinh Truong, has made everything open source:
github.com/phuctruong/if

Whether this revolutionizes physics or not, it represents the best of scientific methodology:
• Open source code
• Reproducible results
• Zero hidden parameters
• First principles derivation

Worth a look for anyone interested in cosmology, mathematics, or the future of physics.

### Reel 1 (15 sec)
```
POV: You discover one equation explains 95% of the universe

Φ(r) = 1/log(r/r₀+1)

Dark Matter? ✅
Dark Energy? ✅
Zero parameters? ✅

Link in bio to run the code yourself

### Reel 2 (30 sec)
```
Physics community: "We need to find dark matter particles!"

*spends billions*

*finds nothing*

This guy: "What if it's just geometry?"

*tests against 3.5 million galaxies*

*passes at 7 sigma*

Physics community: 😴

### Reel 3 (60 sec)

5 reasons Prime Field Theory is insane:

1. ONE equation explains 95% of the universe
2. ZERO adjustable parameters
3. Validated against 3.5 MILLION galaxies
4. Significance: >7σ (discovery threshold is 5σ)
5. Code is OPEN SOURCE - anyone can verify

The equation: Φ(r) = 1/log(r/r₀+1)

Why haven't you heard of it?
Because the physics establishment has billions invested in particle searches.

But code and data don't lie.

## Podcast Talking Points

### 5-Minute Pitch
1. Open with the mystery: 95% of universe is "dark"
2. The problem: Billions spent, no particles found
3. The solution: Prime Field Theory
4. The proof: 3.5M galaxies, >7σ
5. The call: Check the code yourself

### Key Soundbites
- "One equation, zero parameters, 95% of the universe"
- "The math is literally one line"
- "Code and data don't lie"
- "Physics has a reproducibility crisis - this is fully reproducible"
- "The establishment doesn't want to admit they've been wrong for decades"
