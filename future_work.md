Prime Field Theory: Future Work and Validation Roadmap
1. Overview
The Prime Field Theory has demonstrated remarkable success in predicting the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe as a zero-parameter model for dark matter. The initial validation against SDSS, DESI, and Euclid data for the galaxy correlation function (ξ(r)) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) peaks provides a strong foundation for the theory.

This document outlines the roadmap for validating the 11 remaining predictions. The work is organized into four distinct analysis notebooks (or "collabs"), each focused on a specific type of cosmological or astrophysical data. This approach ensures a systematic and thorough verification of the theory's broader implications.

2. Completed Work: The LSS Validation Suite
The foundational dark matter component of the theory has been successfully validated against the premier large-scale structure surveys in modern cosmology. This work proves the core mechanism of the theory across a wide range of redshifts and galaxy types.

4. Future Notebook Descriptions
Notebook 1: lss-advanced-probes.ipynb
This notebook will extend the successful LSS analysis to test secondary predictions of the theory using the same galaxy catalogs.

Void Growth: We will use void-finding algorithms on the SDSS and DESI data to test the prediction that cosmic voids grow faster than in the standard model.

Prime Resonances & Redshift Quantization: We will analyze the galaxy power spectrum and redshift distributions to search for the predicted subtle resonances and clustering patterns.

Notebook 2: dark-energy-validation.ipynb
This notebook will focus solely on Prediction #10, providing a dedicated test of the theory's dark energy component.

Equation of State w(z): We will compare the predicted evolution of the dark energy equation of state, w(z) = -1 + 1/log²(1 + z), against combined observational constraints from Type Ia supernovae (Pantheon+), BAO, and CMB data. This provides a powerful, independent validation of the theory's ability to unify both dark matter and dark energy.

Notebook 3: cmb-analysis.ipynb
This notebook will test the theory's prediction on the earliest possible snapshot of the universe: the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).

CMB Multipole Peaks: We will analyze the publicly available CMB angular power spectrum data from the Planck satellite to search for the predicted peaks at multipole moments corresponding to prime numbers (ℓ = p × 100).

Notebook 4: astrophysical-tests.ipynb
This notebook will test the theory's predictions on smaller, astrophysical scales.

Modified Tully-Fisher Relation: We will use publicly available data from galaxy rotation curve surveys (like SPARC) to test the predicted modification to the Tully-Fisher relation, where the luminosity-velocity exponent n varies with velocity.

Cosmic Time Spurts: We will analyze deep-field data from JWST and Hubble to look for evidence of accelerated or "bursty" galaxy formation at the predicted cosmic epochs.
